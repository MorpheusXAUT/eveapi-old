## EVE Online API Client
eveapi is a library that provides access to the EVE Online XML API.

Forked from [flexd's eveapi](https://github.com/flexd/eveapi) with added
features.

This fork is designed specifically for use with COF internal applications. I do
not make any claims about API stability or external use.
